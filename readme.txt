Complement to know how many times a Post has been seen

== Description ==
With this plugin, you can easily see how many people have viewed a Post

It only runs on Posts and after some time has passed through an Endpoint, so it doesn't affect CWV, and the page loads quickly.

The post meta that we store the value in is "views".

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your
WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
